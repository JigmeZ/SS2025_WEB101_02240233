Working on the data visualization project helped me understand how to present complex data in a clear and interactive way using React. I learned how to use different chart components to display sales, customer, and visitor data effectively. This experience improved my skills in frontend development and showed me the importance of visualizing data for better insights.

In this project, I built a sales analytics dashboard using React. I implemented multiple charts to visualize monthly sales, product category distribution, customer acquisition, and weekly visitors. I used reusable components to organize the dashboard and styled it for a clean, modern look.

The dashboard includes the following types of graphs:

- A line or bar chart for monthly sales performance
- A pie or doughnut chart for product category distribution
- A stacked or grouped bar chart for customer acquisition (new vs. returning customers)
- A line chart for weekly visitors

These visualizations help present key business metrics in an accessible and interactive way.

i couldn push the data visulization in the github as it says another git repository inside the current repo..
