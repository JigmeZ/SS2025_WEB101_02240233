## Reflection

Working with React and Vite in this project has given me practical experience in setting up a modern frontend development environment. I learned how Vite streamlines the development process with fast hot module replacement and simple configuration. Integrating React with Vite made it easy to start building interactive user interfaces quickly.

Additionally, exploring state management with Zustand helped me understand how to manage and share state efficiently in React applications. Zustand's minimal API and ease of use made it straightforward to implement global state without unnecessary complexity.

Overall, this project improved my skills in React, modern tooling with Vite, and state management using Zustand, preparing me for building scalable and maintainable web applications.
