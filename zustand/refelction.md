# Zustand State Management Project

## 1. Documentation

### Main Concepts Applied

- **React with Vite:** Set up a modern frontend development environment using Vite for fast hot module replacement and simple configuration.
- **State Management with Zustand:** Used Zustand for efficient and minimal global state management in React applications.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Built interactive user interfaces using reusable React components.
- **Tooling:** Leveraged Vite's development features for rapid feedback and streamlined workflow.

## 2. Reflection

### What I Learned

- Gained practical experience in configuring React projects with Vite for improved development speed.
- Learned how Zustand simplifies global state management compared to more complex solutions.
- Understood the benefits of minimal APIs and how they reduce boilerplate in state management.

### Challenges Faced and Solutions

- **Challenge:** Integrating Zustand into an existing React project and ensuring state updates propagated correctly across components.
- **Solution:** Carefully followed Zustand documentation and used React DevTools to debug state changes, ensuring all components subscribed to the correct state slices.

Overall, this project improved my skills in React, modern tooling with Vite, and state management using Zustand, preparing me for building scalable and maintainable web applications.
