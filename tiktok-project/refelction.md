# TikTok Project Reflection

Working on the TikTok project was both insightful and rewarding. It allowed me to explore creative content production, learn how to engage audiences, and leverage current trends on social media.

## Main Takeaways

2. **Analytics:** Monitoring metrics like views, likes, and shares provided valuable feedback on what resonates with viewers.
3. **Collaboration:** Teamwork improved my communication and project management skills.

## Challenges

- Adapting to rapidly changing trends and audience interests.

## Conclusion

This project enhanced my understanding of digital marketing and social media dynamics. It also inspired me to keep finding new ways to connect with online audiences.

## Practical 1

This practical gave me hands-on experience with building modern web apps like TikTok using Next.js and React. Setting up the project taught me how to configure the development environment with Tailwind CSS and ESLint, organize code in the src/ directory, and implement routing with the App Router.

Creating layout components and navigation pages deepened my understanding of component-based design. I also practiced building a video feed and sidebar navigation similar to TikTokâ€™s interface.

A key learning point was working with React Hook Form for form handling. I practiced form validation, submission, and error display, which improved my skills in managing user input and building interactive forms.

Overall, this activity strengthened my abilities in React, Next.js, and form handling, and gave me a clearer view of full-stack application structure and development.
